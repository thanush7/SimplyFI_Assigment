 * Dfs Algorithm:
 * Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore all the vertices and edges of a 
 * graph or tree structure. It starts at a designated "source" vertex and explores as far as possible along 
 * each branch before backtracking. The main idea behind DFS is to go as deep as possible along one branch 
 * before moving to another branch.
 * DFS is typically implemented using a stack or recursion, 
 *  It can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs and is used for various graph-related problems
 *  such as finding connected components, detecting cycles, and traversing a graph in a specific order.
